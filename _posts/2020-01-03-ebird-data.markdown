The NZ Bird Atlas website already provides  good data products and visualisations, with tables, interactive maps and personal birding effort statistics.

Finding data to download and visualise from the NZ Bird Atlas website 
([eBird data products](https://ebird.org/atlasnz/science/download-ebird-data-products "eBird data products")){:target="_blank"} takes a little time. The first port of call is through the Science section of the website, which provides instructions on downloading:

- eBird Basic Dataset (EBD)
- eBird Status and Trends
- eBird Observational Dataset (EOD)
- Accessing your personal eBird data

This last item was a bit confusing as it stated:

> To download your own data go to **My eBird** and then to ‘Download my data’ on the right side ... 

The options on the right-hand side of the [My eBird page](https://ebird.org/atlasnz/myebird "My eBird") for the NZ Bird Atlas looks like:

![atlasnz-my-eBird]({{site.url}}/images/ebird-20200103-atlasnz-my-ebird.png "My eBird menu on right-hand side of page")

This doesn't have a download option. 

However the right-hand side of the default My eBird page, does.
