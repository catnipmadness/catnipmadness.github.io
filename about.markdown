My partner and [I](https://ebird.org/atlasnz/profile/MTQwMDcyNQ "About me") are novice birders and are keen to take on the challenges of the NZ Bird Atlas for our patch of the Manawatu.    

In our professional lives, my partner holds a PhD in Plant Ecology, specifically looking at wetland ecosystems, and works in the biosecurity field. I have worked in local government for 26 years, with some time off for good behaviour to work at the Department of Conservation for 3-4 years. My background is in state of the environment data collection, data analysis, GIS, information management and a bit of process automation on the side.

The bird atlas project is an opportunity for us to work together and bring our particular combo of skills to a contribute to a national project.

We have been collecting data for the Atlas since July 2019, and are looking at ways to maximise our efforts to support the atlas goal of *“record[ing] the presence of all bird species that occur within each square, during each of the four seasons [where] observers should aim to survey as many of the different vegetation or habitat types within each grid square as possible, and to submit a minimum of one complete bird checklist for each location surveyed”* (Ray and McArthur, 2019)[1].
