My partner and [I](about-me) are novice birders and are keen to take on the challenges of the NZ Bird Atlas for our patch of the Manawatu.

We have been collecting data for the Atlas since July 2019, and are looking at ways to maximise our efforts to support the atlas goal of *“record[ing] the presence of all bird species that occur within each square, during each of the four seasons [where] observers should aim to survey as many of the different vegetation or habitat types within each grid square as possible, and to submit a minimum of one complete bird checklist for each location surveyed”* (Ray and McArthur, 2019)[1].
